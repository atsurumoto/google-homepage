# google-homepage
i have just started the odin project
i am attempting to recreate the google homepage
i accidentally pushed the git 4 rounds ago. i got confused that i wasnt supposed to push until the end. only do 'add and commit'. then when final stage ready then push.
i ended up "rebase' and lost the revious 6 revision rounds.
i learned a lot about this process and understand flex box and media queiries a lot better now.
