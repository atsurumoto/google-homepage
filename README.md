# google-homepage
i have just started the odin project
i am attempting to recreate the google homepage
i accidentally pushed the git origin main 4 rounds ago. this created a 'fast foward issue' when i tried to push again.
i ended up "rebase' and lost the revious 6 revision rounds.
i learned a lot about this process and understand flex box and media queiries a lot better now.
still a bit confused with get commands though.
